          <div className="text-white/80 space-y-4">
            <p>
              We started this company because we've seen what happens when construction businesses don't have financial
              control.{" "}
              <strong>Receipts get lost. Cards get passed around. Materials costs spiral out of control.</strong> And
              the result?{" "}
              <strong>Thousands in waste, frustrated teams, and strained relationships with clients.</strong>
            </p>
            <p>
              Our mission is to give small operators the kind of tools big companies take for granted —{" "}
              <strong>intuitive, AI-powered financial infrastructure</strong> that helps you control spend and grow your
              business. We're building modern fintech products for{" "}
              <strong>general contractors, builders, and other construction professionals</strong> — not Silicon Valley
              tech bros.
            </p>
            <p>
              This isn't just software. It's how you finally{" "}
              <strong>stop bleeding cash, cut back on chaos, and get back to building.</strong>

              <p>
                Sal started this company to bring <strong>smart, intuitive financial tools</strong> to the people who
                need them most: small businesses trying to grow without drowning in back-office chaos.
              </p>
              <p>
                Before founding JobVault, Sal was <strong>Head of Commerce at GlossGenius</strong>, where she helped
                scale the platform from 20,000 to 80,000+ businesses and processed over{" "}
                <strong>$2 billion in payments</strong>. As the youngest Executive Team member in company history, she
                led the development of expense management features that saved millions for businesses across the US.
              </p>
              <p>
                Prior to that, Sal advised <strong>Fortune 500 companies at McKinsey & Company</strong>, where she
                focused on real estate, technology, and asset management. She previously{" "}
                <strong>worked at the White House and Senate</strong>.
              </p>
              <p>
                Her passion for serving small businesses comes from personal experience — watching family members build
                small businesses from the ground up, and spending her career bringing order to messy, manual problems.
                Today, she's on a mission to bring{" "}
                <strong>modern fintech and AI into the hands of people who need it most</strong>. The ones doing the
                real work.
